# Local Network File Transfer System (In Progress)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a file transfer system built using **Spring Boot** that allows users to securely send and receive files over a local area network (LAN). The project is currently under development as part of my learning in backend development with Spring Boot.

## 🎯 Features (Planned)
